# Snakes-Game
Classical snakes game developed using html, css and jQuery (Just in Single web page)

I made this game just for fun. My intention was to make this in a technology which doesn't need much resources. So instead of using any main stream language like C, C++ or Java , I have used Javascript to do the logic stuff. Used css and basic html to make the Game's UI. 


Who can take help from it:=>
----------------------------
Students who want to know the logics behind the Classical Snakes Game , can read my code.


Who can contribute:=>
---------------------
Anyone who can write javascript, html and css code. And do all stuff just in single web page (Game.html) because that is the main beauty of this game "A SINGLE WEB PAGE" and nothing else


Future Plans:=>
---------------
1. Sound clip integration
2. Make new Levels
